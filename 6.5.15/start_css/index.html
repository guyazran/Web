            The New Guinea singing dog (also known as the New Guinea dingo, Hallstrom 			dog, bush dingo, New Guinea wild dog, and singer) is a true wild dog once found throughout New Guinea. New Guinea singing dogs are named for their unique vocalization. Little is known about New Guinea singing dogs in their native habitat. There are only two confirmed photographs of wild singing dogs.[2] Current genetic research indicates that the ancestors of New Guinea dingoes were probably taken overland through present day China to New Guinea by travelers during pre-Neolithic times.[3]<img src="_images/car.jpg" width="150px" class="car" alt="this is a car">The New Guinea singing dog (also known as the New Guinea dingo, Hallstrom 			dog, bush dingo, New Guinea wild dog, and singer) is a true wild dog once found throughout New Guinea.

            Writing for the San Jose Mercury News in an analysis of movies that were released around Thanksgiving, Randy Myers placed Old Dogs below "The Scraps: Leftovers that should be immediately placed in Fido's bowl."[4] Myers commented, "We have a winner in the Thanksgiving movie turkey contest."[4] Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, "Too bad this shrilly tuned comedy doesn't demand more than clock-punching effort from everyone involved."[16] Tim Robey of The Telegraph savaged the film, saying, "Old Dogs is so singularly dreadful it halts time, folds space and plays havoc with the very notion of the self."[17] He added to the review, "Being a film critic is a wonderful job, but there are weeks when the bad film delirium strikes and we'd all be better off in straitjackets. A colleague opined to me the other day that this might be the deadliest run of releases in his 20-year history on the job, and I can completely see that." He also said, "You'd have to hate your family to take them to this!" He gave the film zero stars.
